# AlzheimersDeepLearning
AlzheimersDeepLearning is an exploratory and educational project that delves into the application of deep learning for Alzheimer's disease research. This repository houses two main components:<BR>
- [ ] [MRIALZ]: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of Alzheimer's disease stages using MRI scans,<BR>
- [ ] and [MRIALZ_DCGAN]: an exploration into leveraging AI to generate synthetic MRI images indistinguishable from real MRI images via Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).<BR>

While the initial intention behind the DCGAN project was to augment MRI data for improved model training, I realized only once I had started generating decent images that method could be problematic for training a model that was intended to be used for real-life detection. Therefore, the DCGAN project serves more as a fun challenge to see how realistic the DCGAN MRI images could become.
